This screen includes:\n    - An input field for a number.\n    - A display showing the result of (number / 2) - 50.\n    - A function to display an additional result with the calculation shown twice side by side, with +100 added to the left result and -100 subtracted from the right result.\n\nFor the design, let's consider:\n\n- **Colors:** A light base color, dark primary text, and a vibrant accent color for interactive elements.\n- **Typography:** Modern, clean fonts for readability.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-08-19T11:10:20.314186"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create an aircraft tail number management app with a calculator feature.

Add multiple aircraft tail numbers on the home screen\n2. Click any tail number to open its dedicated calculator\n3. Enter numbers and get the calculated result using the formula `(number \u00f7 2) - 50`\n4. Optionally view additional results showing the main result \u00b1100 side by side\n5.
